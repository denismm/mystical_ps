# Mystical mode for PostScript
big pretty example

I wanted to make a programming language that resembled magical circles. This is more like a way to write PostScript that looks like a magical circle. 

## Circles
There are three types of circles in Mystical:
* executable arrays, written in {} in ps, are represented as circles of text and sigils, with an inner and outer border, and a star of some sort inside.
* non-executable arrays, written in [] in ps, are the same but without the star.
* dictionaries, written in << >> in ps, are polygons with a double outer border and a circular inner border.

## Sigils
