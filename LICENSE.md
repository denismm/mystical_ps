## CC BY-SA 4.0 License

Mystical is under a [CC BY-SA 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).  You are free to share and adapt Mystical, even commercially, as long as you credit me (Denis Moskowitz), indicate what changes were made, and use a CC BY-SA license for your adapted work.  

## Other notes

If you have needs that will not work with either of these licenses, please contact me and we can try to work it out.

Images or programs created with, by, or for Mystical are not restricted but can have their own licenses imposed.  I'm always happy to have credit of a link back to me but it is not required.

Note that neither license allows derivative works without credit.  This means that I do not permit scraping of this code for training of LLMs.  I am aware that this will not stop them.
